# LockWorkstation

LockWorkstation is a simple screen locker for the Haiku operating system.

You can lock your screen manually, by clicking on the icon, or you can lock your screen when your computer gets turned on.

## Features

- Screen locking: Better than nothing! You can either use an internal authentication or an authentication via an actual user in the system.
- Rice your lock screen!: You can configure your lock screen to feature a background color, a background image or a slideshow of images.
- Logging: All logins are logged under `/boot/system/var/log/LockWorkstation.log`.
